    // Amulet of Vigor ("Whenever a permanent you control enters tapped, untap

    // permanent named by the `ZoneChanged` event — NOT the (untapped) Amulet.

    // effect (tapping the entering permanent and emitting a real `ZoneChanged`
    // event), then `process_triggers` scans the battlefield for matching
    // observer triggers and stacks them. On pre-fix `main`, the buggy
    // `SourceIsTapped` condition reads the untapped Amulet → trigger never
    // fires → these tests fail.
