//! Engine-authored presentation projections over `GameState`.
//!
//! These "derived views" are computed just-in-time at serialization

//! consume the pre-grouped shape directly and never compute game logic
//! themselves — per CLAUDE.md's "engine owns all logic" invariant.
//!
//! Contrast with `crates/engine/src/game/derived.rs`, which contains

//! aggregation, etc.). This module is a thin presentation-facing wrapper
//! that composes those helpers into a client-ready shape.
