//! Regression tests for GitHub issue #508 — Belbe, Corrupted Observer and
//! Thornbow Archer life-loss behavior.
//!
//! Both bugs were parser bugs (the life-loss tracking primitive itself is
//! correct):
//!
//! 1. **Belbe** — "the active player adds {C}{C} for each of your opponents
//!    who lost life this turn" parsed to `Effect::Unimplemented` because the
//!    mana dispatcher only fired on a bare `add ` prefix; the `{C}{C}` ×2
//!    multiplier was also dropped. After the fix the trigger body lowers to
//!    `Effect::Mana` with a `Multiply { factor: 2, inner: Ref { PlayerCount {
//!    OpponentLostLife } } }` colorless count, routed to the active player.
//!
//! 2. **Thornbow Archer** — "each opponent who doesn't control an Elf loses 1
//!    life" silently dropped the "who doesn't control an Elf" qualifier, so
//!    the effect over-applied to every opponent. After the fix the trigger
//!    carries `PlayerFilter::ControlsCount { <Elf>, EQ, Fixed(0) }`.
//!
//! Both tests drive the full pipeline through `apply` — no synthetic events.
