//! Runtime test for CR 508.6 — "the number of opponents you attacked this
//! turn" (Militant Angel) must resolve against real declare-attackers state.
//!
//! Militant Angel reads:
//!   "Whenever Militant Angel attacks, create a number of 1/1 white Soldier
//!    creature tokens equal to the number of opponents you attacked this turn."
//!
//! The `PlayerCount { OpponentAttackedThisTurn }` filter resolves against
//! `state.attacked_defenders_this_turn[controller]`, which is populated by
//! `record_attackers_declared` during the real DeclareAttackers step (CR 508.5:
//! the defending player is the player/planeswalker-controller/battle-protector
//! the creature is attacking). This test drives the full pipeline through
//! `apply` — it does NOT hand-insert into the substrate map (that would be a
//! shape test). It then resolves the public `resolve_quantity` against the
//! post-declare state and asserts the count reflects the opponent attacked.
//!
//! These tests use synthetic creatures (`add_creature`), so no card database is
//! loaded and they run identically in CI and local Tilt.
