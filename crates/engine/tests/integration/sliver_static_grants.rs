//! Intrinsic permanent statics that previously mis-routed into a kind:"Spell"
//! GenericEffect (never registered with the layer system) now land as
//! top-level `static_abilities` and resolve through the real continuous-effect
//! layer pipeline.
//!
//! Gap A — "All <subtype> have <keyword>" universal-quantifier grant
//! (Crystalline Sliver: "All Slivers have shroud."). CR 205.3 (subtypes),
//! CR 604.1 (static abilities are continuously true), CR 702.18a (Shroud).
//!
//! Gap B — self/typed "can't be blocked except by <filter>" evasion static.
//! CR 509.1b (the defending player checks each creature for block
//! restrictions). The restriction must be live in declare-blockers, so it has
//! to be a top-level continuous static, not a spell-resolution effect.
//!
//! These tests drive the REAL pipeline through `apply()` (priority passing /
//! declare-attackers-blockers) — they never hand-construct expected state. The
//! assertions read the post-layer keyword set / the engine's own
//! `find_legal_targets` and block-legality validation.
