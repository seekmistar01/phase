//! Issue #1428 — Crossway Troublemakers.
//!
//! Crossway Troublemakers has a static ability: "Attacking Vampires you control
//! have deathtouch and lifelink."
//!
//! The bug was that deathtouch and lifelink only appeared on attacking Vampires
//! after combat damage was dealt, instead of being active for the entire combat
//! phase. This happened because `FilterProp::Attacking` wasn't re-evaluated
//! until after damage assignment.
//!
//! The fix adds `state.layers_dirty = true` after populating `combat.attackers`
//! in `declare_attackers`, ensuring continuous effects with `FilterProp::Attacking`
//! are re-evaluated immediately when creatures become attackers.
//!
//! CR 506.4: A creature is "attacking" from when it is declared as an attacker
//! until it leaves combat or combat ends.
//! CR 702.2c: Deathtouch - any nonzero damage is lethal.
//! CR 702.15b: Lifelink - damage causes controller to gain that much life.
