//! CR 601.2c + CR 115.3 — object-target distinctness WITHIN one instance of the
//! word "target".
//!
//! The Wise Mothman's milled trigger ("…put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to X
//! target creatures…") is a single `multi_target` instance of "target": its
//! slots must be mutually distinct objects (CR 601.2c). A controller must not be
//! able to drop the same creature into two of those slots.
//!
//! These tests drive the real trigger through the `apply` pipeline (a genuine
//! Tome Scour mill fires the trigger), then exercise BOTH enforcement gates:
//! the offered set surfaced on the live `TriggerTargetSelection` prompt
//! (`ChooseTarget` path) and the whole-selection validate path
//! (`SelectTargets`). The cross-instance reuse guard (the binding CR 601.2c
//! "Destroy target artifact and target land" Example) lives as a spec-layer unit
//! test inside `game/ability_utils.rs`, where the two-distinct-instance
//! abilities can be constructed directly.
