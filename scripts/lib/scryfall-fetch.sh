# Shared hardened fetch helpers for the gen-scryfall-*.sh scripts.
#
# Scryfall's API is fronted by Cloudflare, which throttles bursty or
# anonymous-looking traffic by returning a NON-JSON body (e.g.
# "error code: 1015") while a bare `curl -s` still treats the request as
# successful (no --fail). Piping that body into jq fails with
#   jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column N
# and takes the whole build down. The failure is transient, which is why a
# rerun "fixes" it.
#
# These helpers close that gap: they fail-fast on HTTP errors, retry transient
# throttles (429 / 5xx / 1015) with backoff, send the User-Agent + Accept
# headers Scryfall's API guidelines ask for (anonymous traffic is throttled
# harder), and validate that a downloaded file is real JSON before any
# downstream jq transform touches it.
#
# Source this file; do not execute it. Callers keep their own `set -euo
# pipefail`, and a non-zero return here propagates as a fail-fast exit.

# Custom UA + explicit Accept per Scryfall API guidelines; --retry-all-errors
# (curl >= 7.71) retries the Cloudflare throttle bodies that --retry alone
# would skip because they can arrive with a non-5xx status.
